        <h1>Rob Harvill</h1>
        <p><em>Technology Consultant and Cyber Security Professional</em></p>
        <p>You can pick any video game to challenge Rob, but he will still find
          a way to beat you at your own game. Cyber Security is not all fun and
          games, but it should be. Rob leverages his customer service experience
          and technology background to solve problems and get results for his clients.
          Rob and his wife, Casey, both grew up in Staunton, Virginia. They have two
          young boys, Warren and Lincoln. The family would not be complete without
          their dogs: Calvin, Marvin, and Braden. With a passion for community
          service, Rob uses his technology acumen to support local non­profits.
          He is a member of the Shenandoah Valley Kiwanis. Rob unwinds at the end
          of a long day by reading to his kids, playing video games,
          or watching a good documentary.
